# ZeroScripts Open Sources
+ This folder contains open sources scripts in ZeroScripts family.
### [ZeroAuthentication (OSS)](https://github.com/teppyboy/RbxScripts/blob/master/ZeroScripts/Authentication/ZeroAuthentication.lua)
+ This is the complete source of ZeroAuthentication EXCEPT the important part like Discord webhook, etc.
+ Why? 
  + Because i think put it into PSU isn't a really good idea since it lags and this script has nothing to do with games so no reason for me to close-source it.
